            <h4>The Internet Isn’t Safe. That’s Why You Need a VPN.</h4>

          Get more from the Internet—especially privacy, anonymity and safety—by using a VPN before you do anything online! Who doesn’t love the Internet? It delivers information, answers, entertainment and connections to you, on demand, in seconds. From anywhere and at any time from our desktop computers, laptops, smartphone and tablets. It’s a life-saver for students of all ages, moms, businesses, organizations…everyone. But the Internet is not perfect. It has some built-in flaws that make you vulnerable when you’re online. You should know that, because hackers, government and other snoopers and advertisers take full advantage of it.
